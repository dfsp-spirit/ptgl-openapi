        Search for all fold identifiers of a protein graph. The graph is defined by the protein (PDB ID), chain, and the graph type. A fold, also known as a folding graph, or more generally, a connected component of a graph, is a part of a full protein graph. Fold identifiers are simple, zero-based indices that can be used to query more specific information in subsequent API calls.
