# ptgl-openapi
OpenAPI specification for the API of the Protein Topology Graph Library (PTLG).


## About the PTGL

The PTGL is a web server and database of protein structure topologies. It is based on topology graphs of different levels of abstraction that can be computed from information in the Protein Data Bank, visualized and used for further analyses.

See [ptgl.uni-frankfurt.de](http://ptgl.uni-frankfurt.de) for the PTGL service, or find the source code at [github.com/MolBIFFM/PTGLtools](https://github.com/MolBIFFM/PTGLtools).


## About this repository

This repository contains a formal API specification for the public API of the PTGL, written according to the [OpenAPI standard](https://www.openapis.org/).

Of course, this specification can be used by programmers to manually create clients. However, it can also be used with tools like Swagger to automatically generate API documentation as well as API clients in more than a dozen programming languages.

You can find this specification [here on swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/TimSchaefer/PTGL-API/1.0.0) and try the API live, generate documenation and clients.
